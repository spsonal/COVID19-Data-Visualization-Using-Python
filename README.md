# COVID19-Data-Visualization-Using-Python
In this project I have used the COVID19 dataset which consist of the data related a cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, and deaths cases. I have prepared this dataset to answer these questions: How does Global Spread of the virus look like? How intensive the spread of the virus has been in the countries?, Does covid19 national lockdowns and self-isolations in different countries have actually an impact on COVID19 transmission? I have used the Plotly module, which is a great visualization tool in python, in order to plot some insightful and intuitive graphs to answer the questions.
